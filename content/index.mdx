The golang community is a big place and it is constantly growing. What we would like to
achieve by a series like this is to help beginners find some interesting topics to refer to.
In the world of development, it is pretty easy to search for resources once you know what
you're looking for but it is hard to find out if something exists in the first place.
What I mean by this is that it may be hard for people to know about certain terms and what
they do before they can search for a detailed explanation and functionality.
The aim is to bridge that gap and provide readers with a fun learning experience.

This website **will not** be focusing upon the syntax side of things, assuming the fact that the readers are familiar
about the syntax of Go programming language. It will be more of a real world and practical approach
while tackling new technologies, carefully explaining about why we need them in the first place.
